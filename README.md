A Place where I'm going to place snippets out of a  project where I'm working on.

It could be anything, javascript, php, css, html, svg whatever?

All free to use but without any quarantee or responsibility they work as intended, it's all at your own risc!

Each discipline will have it's own md file with some details.

Finally, most of what I place here, is of what I have learned from making **mistakes!** and I still make them to **learn more!**

Positive but Critical feedback is welcome!

Just created a new directory 'Shorties' for my indidual js files and my EditorManager
